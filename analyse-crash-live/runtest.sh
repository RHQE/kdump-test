    # From the maintainer, Dave Anderson:
    #
    #  foreach bt
    #  foreach files
    #
    # Any "foreach" command option should *expect* to fail given that the
    # underlying set of tasks are changing while the command is being run.
    #
    #  runq
    #
    # The runq will constantly be changing, so results are indeterminate.
    #
    #  kmem -i
    #  kmem -s
    #  kmem -S - The "kmem -S" test is invalid when runing on a live system.
    #
    # The VM, and the slab subsystem specifically, is one of the most active
    # areas in the kernel, and so the commands above are very likely to run
    # into stale/changing pointers and such, and may fail as a result.
